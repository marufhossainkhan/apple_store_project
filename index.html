            <p class="subtag2 smalltxt">Find photos and other attachments from conversations
                To see all of the photos, links, and other attachments that were exchanged in a conversation, select the
                conversation in the sidebar, then click the Details button in the upper-right corner of the window, or
                press Command-I.
                In macOS Monterey, you can also see these items in the Shared with You section of the corresponding app.
                For example, photos and videos you receive automatically appear in the Shared with You section of the
                Photos app, and links to websites appear in the Shared with You section of the Start Page in Safari.
                Pin important conversations
                In macOS Big Sur or later, you can pin a conversation to the top of the conversation list in the sidebar
                so that you can quickly get to it.
                Control-click the conversation to open a shortcut menu, then choose Pin.
                Or drag the conversation to the top of the sidebar.

                In macOS Monterey, you can pin links and other content that you receive, such as podcasts and TV shows.
                Control-click the item, then choose Pin from the shortcut menu. The item is then elevated in the Shared
                with You section of the corresponding app, in Messages search, and in the Details view of the
                conversation.
                Mute conversations
                If you don't want to be disturbed by notifications related to a conversation:

                Select the conversation in the sidebar.
                Click the Details button in the upper-right corner of the window.
                Select Hide Alerts.
                If a recipient is using Focus to silence notifications, their status appears automatically in Messages,
                so others know not to interrupt. To set up Focus for yourself, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences,
                click Notifications & Focus, then click the Focus tab. This feature is available in macOS Monterey.</p>

            <p class="subtag2 smalltxt">The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are smartphones designed and marketed by
                Apple Inc. They are the sixteenth generation flagship iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone
                13 Pro Max. The devices were unveiled alongside the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus at the Apple Event at
                Apple Park in Cupertino, California on September 7, 2022[7][8] and were made available on September 16,
                2022. Pre-orders for the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max began on September 9, 2022.[9]

                The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are the first iPhones to have a new type of cutout display
                called "Dynamic Island", replacing the notch since the iPhone X introduced in 2017. iPhone 14 Pro and
                iPhone 14 Pro Max models (as well as the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus) sold in the United States drop support
                for physical SIM cards, making them the first iPhone models since the CDMA variant of the iPhone 4 to
                not come with a discrete SIM card reader.[</p>

            <p class="subtag2 smalltxt">The iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max (stylized and marketed as iPhone Xs and iPhone
                Xs Max; Roman numeral "X" pronounced "ten")[13][14] are smartphones designed, developed and marketed by
                Apple Inc. They are the twelfth-generation flagships of the iPhone, succeeding the iPhone X.[15] Apple
                CEO Tim Cook announced the devices alongside a lower-end model, the iPhone XR, on September 12, 2018, at
                the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park. Pre-orders began on September 14, 2018, and the devices went on
                sale on September 21.[16]

                Improvements besides increased computing speeds include dual-SIM support, filming with stereo audio, and
                strengthened water resistance.

                The XS Max was the first plus-sized iPhone to have the newer reduced bezel form factor, as the iPhone X
                did not have a larger variant.

                Apple no longer sells the iPhone XS and XS Max as well as the iPhone 7 and its Plus variant as of
                September 10, 2019, after the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro announcement.

                XS and XS Max are the final models of iPhone to feature 3D Touch.</p>
